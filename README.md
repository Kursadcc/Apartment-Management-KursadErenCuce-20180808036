The Apartment Management System is a web-based application developed using pure PHP and MySQL, managed through phpMyAdmin. It allows administrators and residents to manage apartment-related tasks efficiently. Key features include resident management, apartment details, rent payment tracking, maintenance requests, and a notice board for announcements. The system uses PHP for backend processing, HTML/CSS for the user interface, and MySQL for storing all apartment and user data. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of web development without frameworks, focusing on practical database and server-side scripting skills.
